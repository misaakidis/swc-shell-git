Welcome to Software Carpentry bootcamp!
-------------
Software Carpentry's mission is to help scientists and engineers become more productive by teaching them basic lab skills for computing like program design, version control, data management, and task automation. This two-day hands-on bootcamp will cover basic concepts and tools; participants will be encouraged to help one another and to apply what they have learned to their own research problems.


Requirements
-------------
Please take some time *before* the bootcamp to install required software.
For the sessions of "Introduction to task automation with the Unix shell" and "Version control with Git & Github" **The Bash Shell and Git** should be installed on your system.  
For up-to-date information about software installation and configuration problems, and their solutions, see [this wiki page](https://github.com/swcarpentry/bc/wiki/Configuration-Problems-and-Solutions).


About this repository
-------------
In the beginning of the bootcamp we will *clone* this repository, which includes learning material and sample files for us to experiment with.  
In order to do so in a shell execute:  
``git clone https://github.com/misaakidis/swc-shell-git.git``  
There will be a new directory *swc-shell-git* with the structure:

  * README.md: The file you are actually reading now.
  * gloss.md: A glossary with terms we will be using throughout the workshop.
  * LICENSE.md: The license Software Carpentry instructional material is made available under.
  * Lessons: Reading material that you can always review in the future.
  * resources: Sample files and scripts we will be using during the workshop.
  * rules.md: Great collection of rules to welcome you in the world of programming!
